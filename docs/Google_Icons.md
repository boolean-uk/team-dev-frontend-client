# The App currently has the `Material Symbols` from [Google](https://fonts.google.com/icons) imported, so everyone can use it

## Add into the jsx

- If creating an Icon, use the `<span>` HTML element to add the icon
- Assign the `className` to be _"material-symbols-outlined"_, it is quite big, but it is what it is üòÅ

```html
material-symbols-outlined
```

- Within the element, add the `Icon name`. Check list of icons [here](https://fonts.google.com/icons).

```jsx
<span className="material-symbols-outlined">settings</span>
```

\_It will return this beautiful svg icon

## What name to put within the `<span>`?

In the [Google Icons website](https://fonts.google.com/icons) you find the list of all icons. They have the `icon` preview and its `name`.

If I want to add the `delete` icon to my jsx, I would add `delete` to my span, like this:

```jsx
<span className="material-symbols-outlined">delete<span>
```

## Remember to always put the `className`

Easy huh?
